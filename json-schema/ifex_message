On the one hand we have traditional reporting requirements (generally instituted by financial markets, institutions or governments) which are most interested in associating activity with a particular account or actual legal person.  On the other hand we have the cryptographic requirement to identify parties to enforce systemic features such as non-repudiation, message integrity, and authentication.  Regarding the notion of parties, we in fact have an IFEX node as a processing entity, in addition to the legal entity or entities who may be the ultimate participants in the more abstract notion of the financial transaction.  Thus, an identifier should be clear in its requirements.  Here, we are seeking to identify a cryptographically sound entity from whom we can extrapolate message integrity over time (ie. through the various hops of a potentially multi-hop IFEX-based settlement process), and in a publicly relatable way (ie. 'party X quoted Y but never followed through' or 'party X reported Y but evidence differed.')"
