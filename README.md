Internet Financial EXchange (IFEX) Protocol
===========================================

Development of the IFEX Protocol, for http://ifex-project.org/

   The Internet Financial Exchange (IFEX) protocol facilitates the
   negotiation of financial transactions between internet-based
   financial endpoints.

The protocol complements other proposals by the IFEX Project that
are available at http://ifex-project.org/our-proposals/

Status
------
The document is really quite an early draft stage, though various
key design decisions have been made that seem appropriate given
research completed thus far in to existing protocols and settlement
systems.
